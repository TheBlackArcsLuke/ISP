This Independent Study Project will use Canadian food retail price data, Survey of household spending food expenditure data, household spending by household type, and related pricing data to illustrate how Canadian grocery spending has changed over time. It will extend these trends to the future in attempt to predict where prices are heading, and visualize how household spending trends will change as a result. 
As a potential stretch goal, this project may incorporate an analysis of how changes to Canadian crop yields and food production have occurred in an attempt to correlate the datasets.
